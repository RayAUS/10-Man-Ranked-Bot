<h2> Usage: </h2>

<i><b>Instructions</b></i>
 COMING SOON
<!--
- Install Discord bot to server
- Specify 10 Mans text channel
- Use command ```!call {game name abbreviation}``` to start a 10 man  (use the short term name used above in the brackets '(game)' eg. !call csgo, !call val, etc, capitals don't matter with game)
  - To cancel a to man at any time, just type ```!cancel {game name}``` 
- At least 10 people must react to the bot when it calls for players
- For ranked:
  - Do ```!ranked```   
  - Once everyone has reacted, If players are using the bot for this game for the **first time** then players will individually have to input their ranks using ```!rank {game name abbreviation} {rank}```, players that have already done this previously for the game being played **do not have to do it again**, ranks are saved and also updated. If you do change your rank name, then you would have to update your rank, again using the same command ```!rank {game name abbreviation} {rank}``` (use the short term name used above in the brackets '(game)' eg. !rank csgo RaY_aus, !rank val Ray#FPDG, !rank lol RayAUS#OCE etc, capitals matter with ranks)
  -  _Again I need to emphasise that_ **csgo** _being the exception that the_ **bot will only take faceit names**, **even if you don't have a faceit rank**, _because it can find your the steam account connected to that faceit account_
  - **Click the accept tick** the bot will output in the chat and teams will be created with generated team names
  - 
- For unranked:
  - Do ```!unranked```  
  - Click the accept tick the bot will output in the chat and teams will be created with generated team names
- Generated teams will be shown in the text chat, and also the uncertainty in elo (if ranked) 
- Have Fun! :slightly_smiling_face:, Also see <a href="#Comands">Commands</a> for more commands

**NOTE** 
<br>
- _TO USE THIS PROGRAM **WITH RANKS**, IT REQUIRES YOUR RANKS THAT YOU INPUT MUST BE PUBLIC FOR WEBSITES LIKE tracker.gg or csgostats.gg, MORE INFORMATION PROVIDED BELOW WHEN YOU **CLICK ON THE GAME BELOW** TO SEE THE PROCESS ON **HOW THE RANKS ARE RETRIEVED**_




_ONLY ONE INSTANCE OF EACH GAME CAN BE USED AT A TIME. Eg. CSGO AND VAL CAN RUN 10 MANS AT THE SAME TIME, BUT NOT 2 CSGO 10 MANS (ON THE SAME SERVER) _
